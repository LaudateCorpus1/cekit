# Environment variables

In Dogen you can use a few environment variables that can infulence how Dogen behaves.

## `DOGEN_SOURCES_CACHE`

Default value: not set

Specifies a different location that could be used to fetch artifacts. Usually this is a
URL to some cache service. You can use following substitutions:

* `\#filename#` -- the file name from the `url` of the artifact
* `\#algorithm#` -- has algorithm specified for the selected artifact
* `\#hash#` -- value of the digest.

### Example

Consider this sources section:

```
sources:
    - url: http://some.host.com/7.0.0/jboss-eap-7.0.0.zip
      md5: cd02482daa0398bf5500e1628d28179a
```

When you set `DOGEN_SOURCES_CACHE` to `http://cache.host.com/fetch?\#algorithm#=\#hash#` then
the JBoss EAP artifact will be fetched from: `http://cache.host.com/fetch?md5=cd02482daa0398bf5500e1628d28179a`.

If `DOGEN_SOURCES_CACHE` would be set to `http://cache.host.com/cache/\#filename#` then
the JBoss EAP artifact will be fetched from: `http://cache.host.com/cache/jboss-eap-7.0.0.zip`.

In all cases digest will be computed from the downloaded file and compared with the expected value.
