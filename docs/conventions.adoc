# Conventions over configuration

This document covers conventions used in Dogen that may help you build Dockerfiles faster and easier.

## Handling YUM/DNF repo files

In case you add YUM/DNF repo files that you want to put to the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory
to enable additional repositories Dogen will handle it for you automatically.

If Dogen will detect files
with `.repo` extension in the `scripts` directory located under the target (output) directory Dogen will
automatically copy all these files to `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory and enable them to be used while
installing packages listed in the `packages` section.

After installation Dogen removes newly added repo files from the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory *automatically*.
If you do not want to have these files removed after installation -- you need to make your repo files
part of some package and install them manually.

### Things to note

1. This feature covers only the situation where you want to add a custom repo file at *build
   time* but you do not want it to be enabled in containers.
2. Repo file name should be the *same* as the repo id in the repository
   (the name between square brackets).
3. There should be *only one* repository per file.
4. Only added repositories will be enabled during install of packages, all other repositories (including default)
   will be *disabled*.

## Running scripts

### Default script name

If you specify an `exec` key for a script, that value will be used as the command name to be executed for a script.

Otherwise, if the environment has `DOGEN_SCRIPT_EXEC` defined and a script with that name exists, it will be used.

Otherwise, if a script with the name `run` exists, it will be execute if it exists.

### Default script execution user

If you specify an `user` key for a script, that value will be used as the `USER` for executing the script.

Otherwise, if the environment has `DOGEN_SCRIPT_USER` defined, it will be used as the `USER`.

Otherwise, dogen will use `root`.
